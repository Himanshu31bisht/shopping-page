🔄 Redux Toolkit Usage
This project uses Redux Toolkit for state management. The cart's state is managed globally, allowing for seamless updates and interactions between components.

Key Features in Redux:
🗂️ Slices: We use Redux slices to define the actions and reducers for the cart functionality. Each slice manages a portion of the app's state, making it modular and easy to scale.
🏬 Store: The store is set up to combine the slices and provide the state to the entire application.
